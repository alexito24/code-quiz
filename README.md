04 code-quiz
I tried adding a timer. However everytime I try to write a code from either W3 school, or other documental website I always get an error in my dev tools, and the timer is not displayed

I was unsuccessful at storing anything on the local storage that was also another problem I ran into. I will do more reasearch on it and change it later once I get that figered out.

Overall I think I got the basics, I will just have to come back to it and modify so I can have the features above.
